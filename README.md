## Overview of the PyBer Analysis
Ridesharing data for the months of January through April of 2019 was analyzed to determine how city type affects the the total fares received.  City types were categorized as either urban, suburban, or rural, and in addition to calculating the total fares each received, the totals were broken down further to understand the average fare amount and number of fares received.  Lastly, a multiple-line graph was created to view the total weekly fares for each city type. The graph clearly shows the differences by city type and how those differences can be used to make decision strategies involving ridesharing.  

## Results
There are several differences in the data when comparing rideshare data between urban, suburban, or rural settings.  In the table below, the total rides, total drivers and total fares collected in urban regions is signficantly more than in suburban or rural settings.  Urban cities have 13 times more rides than rural cities and 2.6 times more rides than suburban cities.  The total fares in urban cities is nearly 9 times that of rural cities and 2 times that of suburban cities.  However, it is interesting to note that the average fare per ride is greater by $10 in rural settings versus urban, and greater by $4 when comparing rural to suburban.  Similarly, the average fare per driver is greatest in rural areas, followed next by suburban areas, with the least amount occuring in urban areas.  Hence, it is believed that while individuals in rural areas are less likely to rideshare, when they do the ride is longer and amounts to a larger fare.
