## Overview of the PyBer Analysis
Ridesharing data for the months of January through April of 2019 was analyzed to determine how city type affects the the total fares received.  City types were categorized as either urban, suburban, or rural, and in addition to calculating the total fares each received, the totals were broken down further to understand the average fare amount and number of fares received.  Lastly, a multiple-line graph was created to view the total weekly fares for each city type. The graph clearly shows the differences by city type and how those differences can be used to make decision strategies involving ridesharing.
